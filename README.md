XMove
=====

MEMS-based motion detection &amp; analysis system like Mircosoft Kinect ＜/br＞

##Basic:

XMOVE is a motion detection project from 2010-2013. All software and hardware are desinged by our group from BUPT. ＜/br＞
This git-project makes all and **only** embedded code open-source. The core MCU is MSP430 designed by TI.＜/br＞

## All hardware:

 2 node on hands as controllor.＜/br＞
 20 nodes on body.＜/br＞
 1 node receive wireless data and process it.＜/br＞

## Parts of software:
I developed a MCU-base system like this:＜/br＞

All code edited by hand (Of course,or by my ass?)＜/br＞

## How it works like:
This is a Unity3D based demo to demonstrate how it works:＜/br＞
